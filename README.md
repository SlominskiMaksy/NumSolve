# NumSolve
A small collection of codes to solve mathematical problems numerically.
This is a personal project that I intend to continue developing in the future by adding more features and functionalities. It serves as a space for my own experiments and learning.

Please note that there are libraries available that are far more powerful and feature-rich than this project. However, this repository focuses on my personal exploration and experimentation with numerical methods.
